/**
 * Arrays in Java are one-dimensional; we use a single index to access each cell
 * of an array. Nevertheless, there is a way we can define two-dimensional arrays in
 * Javaâ€”we can create a two-dimensional array as an array of arrays
 *
 * That is, we can
 * define a two-dimensional array to be an array with each of its cells being another
 * array. Such a two-dimensional array is sometimes also called a matrix. In Java, we
 * may declare a two-dimensional array as follows:
 * int[ ][ ] data = new int[8][10];
