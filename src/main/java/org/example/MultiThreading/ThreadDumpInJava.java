/**
 * Difference between Thread Dump and Heap Dump?
 * A thread dump is a dump of the stacks of all live threads. Thus useful for analysing what an app is up to at some point in time, and if done at intervals handy in diagnosing some kinds of 'execution' problems (e.g. thread deadlock).
 * A heap dump is a dump of the state of the Java heap memory. Thus useful for analysing what use of memory an app is making at some point in time so handy in diagnosing some memory issues, and if done at intervals handy in diagnosing memory leaks.
