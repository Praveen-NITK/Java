5. can park only specific size vehicles in corresponding size spots

assumption:
1. vehicle measurement automation is there
2. payment gateway is there

================= API Design
1. /getAvailableSpots
	input-> vehicleType, garageId
	output -> noOfFreeSpots
2. /bookSpot
	input -> vehicle, inTime, outTime, garageId
	output -> bookingId
3. /calculatePayment
	input -> bookingId
	output -> amount, breakDown

InternalAPi- /payment
		input - > amount, bookingId
		output -> isPaid
